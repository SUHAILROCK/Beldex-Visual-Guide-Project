## About The Project

Beldex Visual Guide is a structured, beginner-friendly educational website that visually explains:

- Privacy Layer Technologies  
- Consensus & Core Mechanisms  
- Network & Infrastructure  
- Research & Advanced Cryptography  

The goal is to simplify complex blockchain concepts using diagrams, flowcharts, and a clean UI structure.

This project was built to make blockchain privacy concepts understandable without needing to read multiple technical papers.
